#1 protein's primary structure

protein's primary structure means the arrangement of aminio acids.

Amino acids have the following format:

different residual R correspond to different amino acid, the reaction between two amino acid forms a peptide. the peptide bond has partial double bonds property, which can not rotate freely. (the adjacent $C_/alpha$ forms a plane,which can rotate)

there are 20 amino acids

#2 protein's secondary structure

protein's secondary structure means we ignore the stucture of side chain, only consider some local structure of the backbone. the hydragen bond beteen amino group and carboxyle group. there are alpha_helix, beta_sheet and loops

# protein's tertiary and quarternary structure
protein's tertiary structure mens the full 3D structure of a protein.protein's quarternary structure means the overall structure of multiple proteins. 

**In summery, the structure of protein changes in respond to the change of environment**
